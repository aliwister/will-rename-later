    """
    A :class:`Parameterized` class is responsible for keeping track of
    which parameters it is dependent on.

    It does NOT manage updates
    for those parameters if they change during some optimization
    process. The :class:`runlmc.parametrization.Model` should take care of
    that.

    Say `m` is a handle to a parameterized class.

    Printing parameters:

        - `print(m)` prints a nice summary over all parameters
        - `print(name)` prints details for param with name `name`
        - `print(m[regexp])` prints details for all the parameters \
           which match regexp
        - `print(m[''])` prints details for all parameters

    Getting and setting parameters::

        m.subparameterized1.subparameterized2.param[:] = 1

    Handling of constraining, fixing and tieing parameters:

        You can constrain parameters by calling the constrain on the param
        itself, e.g::

            m.name[:,1].constrain_positive()
            m.name[0].tie_to(m.name[1])

        Fixing parameters will fix them to the value they are right now. If you
        change
        the parameters value, the param will be fixed to the new value!

        If you want to operate on all parameters use `m['']` to wildcard select
        all parameters
        and concatenate them. Printing `m['']` will result in printing of all
        parameters in detail.
